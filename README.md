# Data-Analytics-with-Oasis-Infobyte-Marketing-Analytics-Customer-Segmentation
Performed customer segmentation to identifying four key clusters based on recency and spending

## Project Objective
To analyze customer behavior through segmentation based on recency and spending, providing targeted strategies to improve engagement, retention, and sales
## Questions (KPIs)
### **Questions (KPIs):**

1. What percentage of customers fall into each cluster (0, 1, 2, 3)?  
2. How does average spending vary across the identified clusters?  
3. What is the churn risk for customers in Cluster 1 (Low Recency, Moderate Spending)?  
4. What percentage of revenue is generated by Cluster 3 (Moderate Recency, High Spending)?  
5. How frequently do Cluster 0 customers (High Recency, Low Spending) make purchases?  
6. What is the average time since the last purchase for each cluster?  
7. How effective are reactivation campaigns for Cluster 1 customers?  
8. What impact do trial discounts have on Cluster 2 (Recently engaged casual buyers)?  
9. How do VIP benefits influence spending and loyalty for Cluster 3 customers?  
10. What are the key characteristics that differentiate high-value customers from other clusters?  

### Insights:

1. Cluster 0 (High Recency, Low Spending):
   - Frequent buyers but with low transaction values.  
   - Likely driven by promotions or low-cost products.  

2. Cluster 1 (Low Recency, Moderate Spending):
   - Past customers who haven't engaged recently.  
   - Moderate spending history indicates potential for reactivation.  

3. Cluster 2 (High Recency, Low Spending):
   - Recently engaged but spend minimally, likely new or casual buyers.  
   - Represents an opportunity to build loyalty.  

4. Cluster 3 (Moderate Recency, High Spending): 
   - Loyal, high-value customers contributing significantly to revenue.  
   - High engagement and spending patterns suggest strong brand affinity.  

### Recommendations:

1. Cluster 0 (High Recency, Low Spending):
   - Introduce loyalty rewards to encourage repeat purchases.  
   - Use upselling strategies to increase transaction value.  

2. Cluster 1 (Low Recency, Moderate Spending):
   - Launch reactivation campaigns, highlighting new products and offers.  
   - Send personalized messages or limited-time discounts to re-engage these customers.  

3. Cluster 2 (High Recency, Low Spending): 
   - Offer trial discounts or first-purchase incentives to increase spending.  
   - Provide personalized product recommendations to foster loyalty.  

4. Cluster 3 (Moderate Recency, High Spending):  
   - Enhance VIP benefits, such as exclusive offers or early access to new products.  
   - Collect feedback to tailor offerings and maintain customer satisfaction.
